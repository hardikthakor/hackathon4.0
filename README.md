### Problem :
Tourism in India, and especially in the serene state Rajasthan which is filled with cultural heritage and rich architectural grandeur. Foreign tourist contributes a lot to the economical benefit from tourism. But the tourists are reluctant nowadays due to the following issues:
1)	Sanitation and Hygiene
2)	Scams and Frauds by Tour Guides
3)	Miscommunication due to distinct languages
4)	Lack of Unified channel for Nearby Necessities
5)	Insufficient Information Channels for Monuments
6)	Lack of Information About the Fairs and Festivals
7)	Issues such as potholes and lack of virtual assistant for queries
8)	Increased Rates of Hotels

### Solution:
### Idea -
    Our Solution to these challenges is the unification of Android Application, Cloud Infrastructure and Artificial Intelligence together posing as a virtual assistant that would cater to all the need of the tourist. 
### Features-
1)	Garbage and pothole Detection and reporting: If the user spots a pile of garbage or potholes along his travel, the user can click a image of the issue and report it for checking. The image then undergoes filters created with the help of deep learning to check the legitimacy of the issue which are if the image is captured from google, if the image is garbage/pothole or not, if any other user has reported the issue from the same location or not. Once the issue has been reported, with the help of artificial intelligence the severity of the issue is calculated and the notification is being provided to the authority of the corresponding pincode. The user can track the complaint status and also chat with the authority about the same. Once the issue has been resolved the authority has to upload an image of the location and the deep learning system checks whether the same issue has been resolved or not.
2)	Speech Translation and Text Translation: A major discomfort for the tourists are not being able to communicate to the local individuals in hour of need, thus to eradicate this, our proposed solution has a Speech translation as well as Text Translation into local as well as foreign languages
3)	Nearby Amenities:   The android application provides the users with list of nearby amenities which includes hospitals, restaurants, cafes etc. These are characterized according to their types and range and can also book a cab towards these amenities.
4)	Hotel Booking:  As most of the tourists are scammed on the basis of hotel rates, our application provides the with the nearby hotels based on his current location and also books the hotels from booking.com
5)	Fairs and Festivals: Most of the tourism apps do not specify the local fairs and festivals that are being taken place in Rajasthan. Our Application specifies all the local fairs and festivals that are being held in that state
6)	Monument Detection:  Tour guides usually misguide the users while giving information of the monuments, thus to safeguard the integrity of the heritage, the tourists can just click an image of the monument and the application with the help of image classification detects the monument and gives information about it.
7)	Signboard Translation: Most of the crucial signboards in India are in the regional language, which can lead to fatal situations due to ignorance of these signboards, hence we have incorporated signboard translation into our application. Wherein the user can click the image of signboard and application converts the signboard into desired language.
8)	Ease Chatbot: In order for easier access to the features, we have provided an intellectual chatbot trained with the help of IBM Watson which is smart enough to respond to all the queries of the user.
9)	Ola and Uber Integration: The users can directly book Uber and Ola to the desired location directly from the application.
10)	Augmented reality: The main highlight of the application is an Augmented Reality powered Uber booking system, If the user is at a particular monument the application calculates the two-nearby monument in each direction and provides the user with an Augmented Reality object that can be used for booking uber to the selected location.
